# Basics
C is a procedural programming language.
It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.

## Basic Data Types in C
int: Stores whole numbers, without decimals
float: Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits
double: Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
char: Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values.

## Basic Format Specifiers
int: %d or %i
float: %f
double: %lf
char: %c
string: %s

## main() function
All valid C programs must contain the main() function.
The code execution begins from the start of the main() function.

## printf function
The printf() is a library function to send formatted output to the screen.
The function prints the string inside quotations.
To use printf() in our program, we need to include stdio.h header file using the #include <stdio.h> statement.

## scanf function
In C programming, scanf() is one of the commonly used function to take input from the user. The scanf() function reads formatted input from the standard input such as keyboards.

## return 0
The return 0; statement inside the main() function is the "Exit status" of the program. It's optional.
